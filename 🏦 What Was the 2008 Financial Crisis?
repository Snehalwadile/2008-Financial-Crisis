The 2008 financial crisis was a global economic collapse triggered by bad loans in the U.S. housing market. It started with banks giving out risky mortgages and ended up crashing banks, stock markets, and entire economies.

📉 How Did It Happen? (Step-by-Step)
1. 🏠 Too Many Risky Home Loans
Banks gave home loans (mortgages) to people who couldn’t afford them (called subprime mortgages).

They believed housing prices would keep rising, so they didn’t worry much.

2. 🧾 Banks Packaged These Loans
Banks bundled thousands of these risky loans into financial products called mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and sold them to investors.

Credit rating agencies wrongly labeled them as safe (AAA), even though they were risky.

3. 💥 Housing Bubble Bursts
Around 2006–2007, housing prices fell, and many people couldn’t pay back their loans.

That meant the MBS lost value, and banks/investors who owned them started losing billions.

4. 🏚️ Big Banks Collapse
Some major banks were heavily involved in these bad loans:

Lehman Brothers collapsed.

AIG and others were bailed out by the government.

5. 😱 Global Panic
Lending froze, businesses couldn’t borrow, people lost jobs and homes.

Stock markets crashed worldwide. It became the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.

🛠️ What Was Done to Fix It?
The U.S. government launched a $700 billion bailout plan (TARP) to save banks.

The Federal Reserve cut interest rates and pumped money into the economy.

New regulations were introduced (e.g., Dodd-Frank Act) to stop this from happening again.
🧠 Why It Matters
The 2008 crisis taught the world that:

Unchecked lending and lack of regulation can lead to disaster.

Complex financial products can hide real risks.

Trust in the banking system is crucial for the global economy.
